    <div class="about">
        <p>Greendale Community College (GCC) is an open-admissions college, located in Greendale County, Colorado. Greendale was first founded in 1974 by Russel Borchert, who was a leading profile in the computer science world. Greendale is most famously known for having amongst its alumni the actor, Luis Guzman. Though Greendale is not as prestigious as our rival City College, it still is an affordable school with over 80 amazing fields to study.</p>

                <p>Before the time of Greendale Community College, the land where Greendale would eventually be built upon, was originally the site of an animal rendering plant. In 1974, the famous inventor Russel Borchert purchased these grounds and founded a technological institute by the name of “Greendale Computery School”. Borchert was later believed to have died of a “computer virus”, so Greendale's at the time dean, Dean Pizzini, decided to seal off Borchert’s computer lab in case there was an actual contagion involved. The city then decided to purchase the campus, turning it into a traditional community college.  </p>

                <p>The building of the newly turned community college was finished in 1977. The official Air Conditioning Repair School was then established only two years later, in 1979.  </p>
                <p>Throughout Greendale’s history there has always been some kind of trouble regarding the school's mascot. It first started in 1983, almost a decade after the school was first founded. There was supposedly a student protest over the school’s racially insensitive mascot “Big Chief Drunky”. In response, the mascot would later be renamed the “Sober Casinoman”, only to be changed sometime later to the “Greendale Grizzlies”. The mascot was then not changed for almost two decades, before Greendale’s current dean, Dean Pelton, created a brand-new mascot, depicted in the picture on the left, representing the diverse student body. This new and improved mascot was given the name “Greendale Human Being”. The “Greendale Human Being” has served as Greendale’s mascot ever since. </p>

                <p> In 2013, Greendale faced a lawsuit from a former graduate who alleged inadequate education and a grading scandal that shook the campus. Dean Pelton assembled a special committee, which not only restored harmony but also enhanced campus life. Their dedication led to an insurance appraiser recognizing the school as a valuable property asset. School board members Carl Bladt and Richie Countee struck a deal with Subway Corporation to purchase Greendale. However, the unexpected return of the school's founder, Russell Borchert, who still owned the land, thwarted the sale. 

                    The subsequent year witnessed a cafeteria roof collapse under the committee's oversight, prompting the hiring of an efficiency consultant. This consultant's role was pivotal in addressing various issues. Additionally, key faculty hires were made, including a new Law professor and an I.T. department head. After a year of dedicated efforts to repair and improve the school, the consultant announced at the end of the 2015 semester that the committee had successfully completed its mission, and Greendale was officially saved. </p>
