                <p>Before the time of Greendale Community College, the land where Greendale would eventually be built upon, was originally the site of an animal rendering plant. In 1974, the famous inventor Russel Borchert purchased these grounds and founded a technological institute by the name of “Greendale Computery School”. Borchert was later believed to have died of a “computer virus”, so Greendale's at the time dean, Dean Pizzini, decided to seal off Borchert’s computer lab in case there was an actual contagion involved. The city then decided to purchase the campus, turning it into a traditional community college.  </p>
